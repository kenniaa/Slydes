# Slydes

A handy little tool to make slideshow presentations using a textual format.

Eventually this will display in a native client or allow exports to HTML, PDF, or (hopefully) PPT.

## Prerequisites

- `make`
- `go`

## Usage

- Clone this repo
- Run `make build`
- `chmod +x ./slydes`
- `slydes -h`

We provide an example `.sly` file [here](./examples/basic.sly). You can find other examples in the `examples/` directory.

Documentation for Sly can be found [here](./SLY.md).
